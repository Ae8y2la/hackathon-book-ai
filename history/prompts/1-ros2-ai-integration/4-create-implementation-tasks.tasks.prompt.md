## Prompt

```text

```

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for the Docusaurus-based ROS 2 educational module. Created 41 specific tasks organized across 5 phases: Setup, Foundational, and three user stories (ROS 2 fundamentals, Python-ROS integration, URDF modeling) in priority order, plus polish phase. Tasks follow proper format with checkboxes, IDs, parallel markers, and story labels where appropriate.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for implementing ROS 2 educational module
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with structured implementation plan
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation with /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All required tasks created with proper format
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Start implementing tasks
