# AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
Content must reflect verified sources. All factual claims must be supported by peer-reviewed literature, authoritative references, or verified data. Zero tolerance for plagiarism.

### Clarity
Content must be accessible to technical readers with a target Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10-12. Complex concepts must be explained with clear examples and visual aids where appropriate.

### Reproducibility
All specifications and code examples must be traceable and reproducible. Every experiment, simulation, or implementation must include sufficient detail for independent verification and replication.

### Rigor
Content must prefer peer-reviewed or authoritative references. At least 50% of all sources must be peer-reviewed publications or recognized authoritative texts in the field.

### Source Attribution
All sources must follow APA citation format. Proper attribution must be maintained for all borrowed content, concepts, and data to ensure zero plagiarism.

### Technical Integration
The Docusaurus book and embedded RAG chatbot must be fully functional and deployed to GitHub Pages. The chatbot must effectively answer queries based on full text or user-selected passages using OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, FastAPI, Neon Postgres, and Qdrant.

## Quality Standards

- **Factual Verification**: All claims must be sourced from reputable, peer-reviewed materials
- **Citation Format**: Strict adherence to APA style guidelines
- **Source Quality**: Minimum 50% of sources must be peer-reviewed or authoritative
- **Plagiarism Policy**: Absolute zero tolerance for uncredited content
- **Writing Clarity**: Maintain Flesch-Kincaid grade level between 10-12 for accessibility
- **Technical Accuracy**: All code examples and specifications must be tested and validated

## Development Workflow

- **Format Standard**: Content must be structured for Docusaurus book deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Integration Requirements**: Chatbot must be seamlessly integrated with the book interface
- **RAG Implementation**: Chatbot must utilize OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, FastAPI, Neon Postgres, and Qdrant
- **Scope Boundaries**: Chatbot limited to answering queries based on book content and user-selected passages
- **Quality Assurance**: All content must undergo verification before publication
- **Testing Protocol**: Both book and chatbot functionality must be thoroughly tested before deployment

## Governance

This constitution establishes the foundational principles and standards for the development of the AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project. All contributors must adhere to these principles, and any deviations require formal amendment procedures. The constitution serves as the ultimate authority for project decisions, quality standards, and development practices.

All code reviews, content reviews, and project decisions must verify compliance with these principles. Any complexity introduced must be justified by clear benefits to the project's core mission of delivering accurate, clear, and reproducible content on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.
